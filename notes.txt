100.7 MB after 100 x500 array

deleted curves but still the same 100.7 MB 

=>curve deletion does not free up any memory as it should



Lesha,


In DAAS 4.02 I've deleted all channels from "DAAS Channel List", 
after that the memory went down to 17MB. There were 5336 channels 
in that list. If we assume all are 1000 points long it's about 
16.3 bytes per point or about 2 doubles per point.



I ran the same experiment with the old version: DAAS 4.01 
It got into 100MB after 16 minutes or 172 channels, so I put it 
on pause.



I left both versions of DAAS open, you can see the memory use 
and can continue running DAAS 4.01 to see it blow up: 
my estimate is that it would require about 3.4 GB of memory.




At this point I am convinced that the original bug is gone.

P.S. Note that there are some glitches in the acquired data on 
DAAS 4.01: it could be some interference from the other instance 
of DAAS running.
